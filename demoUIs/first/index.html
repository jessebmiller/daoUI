<h1>Naive State DAO</h1>
<h2>Example of a DAO managing state</h2>
<p>
  This is the first UI for this DAO, it's pretty basic and could probably
  use some improvement.
</p>
<p>
  Members of the dao at 0xDD0E544Bc37A58423CEE63E67d05e7d978DEE6c7 can
  can propose and vote on new UIs to replace this one.
</p>
<p>
  The DAO is pretty naive so we could build it at the hackathon. Anyone
  can join, propose new UIs, and vote on them. It's a simple majority vote
  and a 240 block voting perios (about an hour).
</p>
<p>
  Ezra or Jesse (who are probably showing you this) could show you how to
  interact with the contract, that's naive right now too, it's probably
  just with the Remix IDE. Maybe you or someone will propose a UI that
  will have a slick UI for proposing the next UI.
